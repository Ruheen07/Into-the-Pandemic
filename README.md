# Into-the-Pandemic
Since Covid pandemic has stretched for too long, masses in general have become much more careless
than before. Without taking the proper precautions, covid cases are booming. The news information or
data does not reveal the correct scenario, but it is the most viewed by almost all the General Public, which
in turn misleads them. So, we planned on to create a comparison between what is real and what is shown.
The implementation of the same follows !
Here we thought to analyze the reliability of news channel coverage on daily cases of covid-19 pandemic.
We compare the graph obtained by plotting daily cases data given by worldometer (considering it as a
reliable source of information) with the graph obtained by plotting daily news articles and webpages
present on the internet archive with the help of Pearsonâ€™s coefficient.
In our project we will be trying to find a direct relation between information on coronavirus on the
internet platform and the number of cases of coronavirus with data of the past few months.
